# Gazelle #

## Summary ##
Gazelle will be a Verlet Integration based physics engine, implemented in C++ using OpenFrameworks.

Currently I'm learning the works of C++, OpenFrameworks, and github all at once, so bare with me.

If you're experienced, and see me doing anything embarrassingly wrong, 
feel free to commit-request, or whatever, any suggestions.

## Status Updates ##
### July 12, 2012 ###
     Computer had troubles handling Visual Studio 2010. 
     Running CCleaner and Defraggler to hopefully speed things up, somewhat.
     Still feel pretty awkward with C++. Pointers/Addresses is a nice added level of control, 
     but are still awkward for me.
     
     I began the implementation of Link constraints. 
     Had to quit early after some frustrations with VS 2010, and computer freezing at inconvenient times.
