# Gazelle #

## Summary ##
Gazelle will be a Verlet Integration based physics engine, implemented in C++ using OpenFrameworks.

Currently I'm learning the works of C++, OpenFrameworks, and github, so bare with me.

If you're experienced, and see me doing anything embarrassingly wrong, 
feel free to commit-request, or whatever, any suggestions.
